					<h2>Our company</h2>
					<p>Are we using narwhal horn in your cores? Thankfully, no narwhals need 
					to be injured to produce our products. The majority of the skis made are using 
					similar materials and are composited in a similar manner but it is 
					how the ingredients get combined and who combines them that make the 
					difference. In the pursuit of the perfect ride, we believe craft, attention to 
					detail, a passion for the sport and a dedication to the 
					community is the difference. It&rsquo;s about being a ski/board company and not 
					an image company.</p>
					<p>We hand pick the core materials, laminate our own cores from continuous 
					wood lengths, precisely cnc our materials, meticulously lay-up the product, 
					and prep the ski/board to be ride-ready on the first day of purchase.
					We offer various graphics created by local artists and designers (see 
					artists bios) for each model we make so you can always find something 
					that meets your aesthetic. Whether or not you are standing in a lift line, 
					skinning a glacier or immersed in the white room you&rsquo;ll love your skis or 
					snowboard.</p>
					<p>All skis/boards are crafted at our shop at the foot of Mt Baker. We support 
					the local ski resorts, businesses, and avalanche centers and encourage 
					you to do so. We don't produce your skis offshore and we produce small 
					quantities so we can maintain high quality.</p>
					<p>We are passionate about four things:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Crafting the highest quality products in the industry with the most unique 
					designs</li>
                  <li>Creating something uniquely yours through personalization</li>
					<li>Building locally and supporting the community</li>
					<li>Being fanatical about skiing and riding</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Our mission is to provide a superior crafted product locally that will bring 
					your &lsquo;woot&rsquo; out.</p>

					<h2>Our team</h2>
					<p>We are skiers and snowboarders passionate about riding 
					the backcountry and deep powder so we make powder specific products. 
					Collectively we have over 30 years of product design experience.</p>
					<p>Dan Dole, a product designer for 18 years, started Red Junction LLC after an 
					observation he had in 2007. He noticed how many people were leaving 
					the resort and going into the backcountry. His wife had been riding a 
					splitboard since 2000 and used to be the only boarder that he would see in the backcountry but that had changed; more skiers and boarders were 
					accessing the backcountry or slackcountry. This seems to be the biggest 
					trend for skiing and snowboarding since, well, snowboarding and as good 
					a time as any to get into the game.</p>
					<p>In 2010, Dan opened Red Junction. He has spent the last three years 
					doing research and development in order to establish a consistent and 
					repeatable process that will produce the highest quality product.</p>
					<p>Behind the scenes, Jennifer Day (Dan&rsquo;s wife) has been working on the 
					visual design and marketing materials for Red Junction. Red Junction&rsquo;s 
					mission wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without the support of friends, family and the 
					local community.</p>

						<p>When I&rsquo;m not designing for you, I&rsquo;m most likely working at my record store,

						<p>Attention to detail: We hand pick the lumber of the highest quality. Each stringer is tested  for flaws and weaknesses before we make them into our cores. We use the highest quality resins and reinforcements to balance ride and durability.</p>
<p>Personalized: We offer a variety of graphics that you can choose from to match your unique style and aesthetic. All the graphics are designed by local designers and artists.</p>
<p>Ride-Ready: Our products are ride ready; no dry bases. We tune and wax each product before we deliver it. You can ride these the day you get them mounted.</p>
<p>Unique Cores: We currently offer three core types, Ultra-stringer, Resort, and Backcountry Carbon. The ultra-stringer core is only on the Maharajah ski. We use thin lengths of poplar, birch and ash to create a durable, stable and lively flexing ski. The Resort core is similar to the Ultra-stringer but with more forgiving ridgitity. The Back Country Carbon is a light wood core with added carbon to give you a touring ski that isn't skittish like other touring skis.</p>
