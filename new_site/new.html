					<h2>Our team</h2>
					<p>Are we using narwhal horn in your cores? Thankfully, no narwhals need 
					to be injured to produce our products. Majority of the skis made are using 
					similar technical materials and are composited in a similar manner. It is 
					how the ingredients get combined and who combines them that make the 
					difference. In the pursuit of the perfect ride, we believe craft, attention to 
					detail, a youthful passion for the sport and the dedicated support of the 
					community is the difference. It&rsquo;s about being a ski/board company and not 
					an image company.</p>
					<p>We hand pick the core materials, laminate our own cores from continuous 
					wood lengths, precisely cnc our materials, meticulously lay-up the product, 
					and prep the ski/board to be ride ready on the first day of purchase.
					We offer various graphics created by local artists and designers (see 
					artists bios) for each model we make so you can always find something 
					that meets your aesthetic. Whether or not you are standing in a lift line, 
					skinning a glacier or immersed in the white room you&rsquo;ll love your skis or 
					snowboard.</p>
					<p>All skis/boards are crafted at our shop at the foot of Mt Baker. We support 
					the local ski resorts, businesses, and avalanche centers and encourage 
					you to do so. We don't produce your skis offshore we produce small 
					quantities so we can maintain high quality.</p>
					<p>We are passionate about three things:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Crafting the highest quality products in the industry with the most unique 
					designs, creating something uniquely yours through personalization</li>
					<li>Building locally and supporting the community</li>
					<li>Being fanatical about skiing and riding</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Our mission is to provide a superior crafted product locally that will bring 
					your &lsquo;woot&rsquo; out.</p>

					<h2>Our company</h2>
					<p>Who are we? We&rsquo;re skiers and snowboarders passionate about riding 
					the backcountry and deep powder so we make powder specific products. 
					Collectively we have over 30 years of product design experience.</p>
					<p>Dan Dole, a product designer for 18 years, started a company after an 
					observation he had in 2007. He noticed how many people were leaving 
					the resort and going into the backcountry. His wife had been riding a 
					splitboard since 2000 and used to be the only boarder that he would see 
					the backcountry but that had changed; more skiers and boarders were 
					accessing the backcountry or slackcountry. This seems to be the biggest 
					trend for skiing and snowboarding since, well, snowboarding and as good 
					a time as any to get into the game.</p>
					<p>In 2010, Dan opened Red Junction. He has spent the last three years 
					doing research and development in order to establish a consistent and 
					repeatable process that will produce the highest quality product.</p>
					<p>In 2012, Dan shared his shop with Dave Summers. Dave has been 
					building snowboards for the last 10 years. He is a true craftsmen and his 
					attention to detail are unmatched. In the autumn of 2013, Dave became 
					the master designer and builder for Red Junction.</p>
					<p>Behind the scenes, Jennifer Day (Dan&rsquo;s wife) has been working on the 
					visual design and marketing materials for Red Junction. Red Junction&rsquo;s 
					mission wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without the support of friends, family and the 
					local community.</p>

									<h2>Maharajah</h2>
									<p>This is a big ski for big mountains and deep powder. With a core made 
									from birch and poplar, the &lsquo;Maha&rsquo; is a perfectly balance of stability, 
									responsiveness and agility. It releases easily because of the significant tip 
									and tail rise but it behaves like a more traditional ski.</p>

									<h2>Honcho</h2>					
									<p>The Honcho is our flagship ski. It&rsquo;s designed to be a versatile ski, at home 
									in the resort or in the BC. The Honcho is a traditional cambered ski with 
									conservative tail rise so it doesn&rsquo;t wash out when you&rsquo;re in a nasty chute. It 
									will excel in trees or while making high speed turns in open bowls.</p>
